 zizzania - WPA handshake hunter
=================================

Info:

    zizzania reads packets from a pcap file or from a wireless device (RFMON
    mode) and recognizes the WPA 4-way handshakes of the clients. Captured
    traffic can be saved to a pcap file that will contain, for each client, the
    handshake followed by its data (IEEE 802.11 unicast data frames only): ready
    for subsequent decryption. When capturing from a device, zizzania keeps on
    deauthenticating the clients it finds until their handshakes are not
    gathered.

Dependencies:

    libpcap-dev (>= 1.1.1)
    libglib2.0-dev (>= 2.24.2)

Install:

    $ make
    # make install

Uninstall:

    # make uninstall

Examples:

    Take a look around:

        # zizzania -i wlan0 -n -a

    Passively wait for handshakes of a specific AP and dump decryptable traffic
    to a file:

        # zizzania -i wlan0 -n -b 11:22:33:44:55:66 -w passive.cap

    Force the reconnection of the clients of two specific APs and dump the
    decryptable traffic to a gzipped file:

        # zizzania -i wlan0 -b 11:22:33:44:55:66 -b aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff -w - | \
                   gzip > active.cap.gz

    Extract the decryptable traffic of a specific AP from a gzipped file and
    dump it to a file:

        $ < file.cap.gz gunzip | zizzania -r - -b 11:22:33:44:55:66 -w crop.cap

    Use tshark to parse an encrypted file (SSID: bar, password: foo) generated
    by zizzania looking for HTTP cookies:

        $ tshark -o wlan.enable_decryption:TRUE \
                 -o wlan.wep_key1:wpa-pwd:foo:bar \
                 -r file.cap -R 'http.cookie' \
                 -T fields -e http.host -e http.cookie
