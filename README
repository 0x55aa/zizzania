Examples:

    Take a look around:

        # zizzania -i wlan0 -n -a

    Passively wait for handshakes of a specific AP and dump decryptable traffic
    to a file:

        # zizzania -i wlan0 -n -b 11:22:33:44:55:66 -w passive.cap

    Force the reconnection of the clients of two specific APs and dump the
    decryptable traffic to a gzipped file:

        # zizzania -i wlan0 -b 11:22:33:44:55:66 -b aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff -w - | \
                   gzip > active.cap.gz

    Extract the decryptable traffic of a specific AP from a gzipped file and
    dump it to a file:

        $ < file.cap.gz gunzip | zizzania -r - -b 11:22:33:44:55:66 -w crop.cap
